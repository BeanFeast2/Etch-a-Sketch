From The Odin Project's HTML&CSS

Learning more about DOM manipulation using Javascript. Spent a lot of time working with event listeners and understanding how events get passed and how to get what I need out of them (event.target.style). I find my self getting a better idea of some basic algorithims and realizing that being able to execute them quicker is helping me improve my problem solving skills. I had to go back and edit my own code a lot due to first making my etch a sketch adjustable with only one "pen size" input number, but later read the assignment closer and adjusted.
